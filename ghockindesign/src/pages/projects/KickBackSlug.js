          KickBack Slug is a video game project that I started work on in January 2021 at Kittens In Timespace.
          My role at Kittens in Timespace is a part time/ freelance games programmer and game designer.
          The game Kickback slug is a 2d side scrolling type of game in where the character a slug uses three different guns to propel their self around the level.

          Working on this game for Kittens in Timespace has also got me used to what it's like to work for a professional games company, a lot of the staff are European which means the office is technically ran on Discord which does mean it has moved with the timea as a lot of people now work from home.
          The ability to work from anywhere in the world and all I need is my laptop has been fantastic and truly revolutionary which I thank Kittens in Timespace for, they have been very patient with me In trying new ways of working such as laptops/ desktops and working while traveling and they have taught me so many industry standard practices that I feel confident to work and communicate with anyone in the computer industry.
          Ive seen the development of Kickback slug since the prototype stage and although Iâ€™ve developed and self-published video games by myself before working as a team and publishing to platforms such as PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo and Steam has been a very proud moment for myself to be a part of.

          Check out the links below for the Steam page of the game and the twitter of Kittens In Timespace, they have more projects ongoing which hopefully I will be a part of.
