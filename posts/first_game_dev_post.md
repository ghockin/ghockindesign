2D game begins

- I haven’t made games for nearly two years now, as I grew bored of it.

- However, I’ve had the itch to develop again.

- My previous experience was developing games in Unity and Unreal, like most developers.

- But this time, I’m going to be testing myself and develop a game for the web.

- I will be using Phaser.js and HTML.

- It’s simple, I know, but I also know that game development is never simple.

- I started making games when I was 13 in Game Maker’s Toolkit, and over the years discovered other engines. They have all been great in their own way, but I always found myself getting stuck at some point. Looking back, I think the problem with these game engines today is too much freedom, which often leads to people getting stuck, watching online tutorials, and then developing similar-looking games with similar assets downloaded from the engine’s store. I say let’s go back to traditional game design—basic code where the developer has to struggle on their own and truly knows how their game works. This adds a certain quirkiness to every game, with random bugs that make the game funny. I do believe many games these days have lost their soul.

- Also, developing smaller but simply coded games is great, as they can be played on any device and don’t require massive installation times. The game files will be minimal and won’t be filled with the optimisation files that engines often impose on the final build.

- I feel that this style of game development is similar to how the great Nick Offerman (Ron Swanson) describes the art of woodworking:

- "In this day and age, we’ve become a bit soft. Everyone can make something—anything, even a simple paper card with a heart and 'I love you' written on it. It doesn’t have to be perfect; what matters is the thought and effort behind it. Making something with your hands is a way of taking chances, living fully, and saying 'I love you' to the world." — Nick Offerman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InDDx3xClrA
